# 📘 Chapter 3 — Classification
_Practice and exercises for Chapter 3 (Classification) from "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" (3rd Ed.)._

## 🔍 Overview
This folder contains hands-on experiments for classification tasks, including:
- Binary and multiclass classification
- Performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Confusion matrix, ROC curves, AUC
- Handling imbalanced datasets
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Examples with Scikit-Learn classifiers (SGD, RandomForest, KNN, LogisticRegression) and the MNIST dataset

## 🎯 Key concepts practiced
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling  
- Training and evaluating classifiers  
- Precision / recall / F1 / confusion matrix visualization  
- Cross-validation with `cross_val_score` & `cross_val_predict`  
- ROC-AUC analysis

## 🛠 Tools & libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Scikit-Learn  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- TensorFlow (optional)  
- ipykernel / Jupyter Notebooks


## 🚀 Quick start
