# 📘 Chapter 3 — Classification
_Practice and exercises for Chapter 3 (Classification) from "Hands‑On Machine Learning with Scikit‑Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" (3rd Ed.)._

## 🔍 Overview
This folder contains hands‑on experiments for classification tasks, including:
- Binary and multiclass classification
- Performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Confusion matrix, ROC curves, AUC
- Handling imbalanced datasets
- Cross‑validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Examples with Scikit‑Learn classifiers (SGD, RandomForest, KNN, LogisticRegression) and the MNIST dataset

## 🎯 Key concepts practiced
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling  
- Training and evaluating classifiers  
- Precision / recall / F1 / confusion matrix visualization  
- Cross‑validation with `cross_val_score` & `cross_val_predict`  
- ROC‑AUC analysis

## 🛠 Tools & libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Scikit‑Learn  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- TensorFlow (optional)  
- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab

> Note: This project does not require any "uv" project initialization (e.g., `uv init`) or installing packages like `uv sync`. Follow the Python/virtual environment instructions below.

## 🚀 Quick start
1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BUFONJOKER/hands-on-ml-ch3.git
    ```
2. Change into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd hands-on-ml-ch3
    ```
3. Install uv:
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    ```
4. Create uv project:
    ```bash
    uv init hands-on-ml-ch3
    ```
5. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
